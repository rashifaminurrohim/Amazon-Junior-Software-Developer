  <h1>My Journey into Web Development</h1>
  <div id="main-content">
    <p>Welcome to my blog! I'm exited to share my journey as I learn web development.
      from HTML basics to advanced CSS tricks, I will document everything here.
    </p>

    <p>One of the most interesting things I've learned so far is how powerful CSS selectors
      can be. They allow me to target and style specific parts of my webpage.
    </p>
    <p class="highlight">Note: This section is styled using a class selector to emphasize
      important information.
    </p>

    <p class="highlight">Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to dive
      deeper into coding!
