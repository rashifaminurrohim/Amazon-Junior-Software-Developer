 * Here are a few things to remember:
 *
 * A superclass reference can refer to subclass objects, enabling another dimension of polymorphism in Java.
 *
 * When a method is overridden in a subclass, and the superclass reference points to that subclass object, the overridden method in the subclass will be executed.
 *
 * This allows you to use general code with a superclass reference while benefiting from the subclass's specific behaviors.
