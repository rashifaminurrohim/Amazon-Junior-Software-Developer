How about, on Tuesday, you ask Toni whether the language he‚Äôll be using during coding time is C++ or Java? Then on Wednesday, when Toni designs the program, ask if he uses a "Simple Design" or "Complex Design". Once Toni starts coding on Thursday, you could ask him if the IDE is "IntelliJ", "Eclipse" or "VS Code".
         *
         * Finally, on Friday, when he runs tests, you could ask if there were errors in the tests. And for a bit of fun, ask if Toni was going to chill "at home", "in a bar", "with friends" or "at a nightclub". Then make sure the appropriate responses are displayed.
         *
         * For case 2 (Tuesday), case 4 (Thursday), and case 7 (Sunday), use a nested switch statement, and if-else for the rest.  This is because these days have more than one possible outcome depending on another factor.
         *
         * For instance, on Tuesday (case 2), Toni might have different tasks depending on the programming language he is using that day. This can be represented as a nested switch statement within the case for Tuesday, with different tasks for each programming language.

         * üñ•Ô∏è  TODO 13: For the remaining days (case 1, case 3, case 5, and case 6), the activities are straightforward and do not depend on another variable, so a simple if-else statement is used.
